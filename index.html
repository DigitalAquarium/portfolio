    <p>Hi, I’m Jonathan, a creative computer science graduate who loves technology and problem-solving! I currently hold a 2:1 from the University of Birmingham and I'm looking to get started with my career in Tech. I've got good fundamentals in mathematics, problem-solving and algorithms and work excellently in a team.</p>
    <p>I’m not into software development because it’s a trend, or because of salary expectations, I’ve genuinely loved tinkering with computers since a young age. I've built with Scratch since I first learnt about it in 2011 and Minecraft's scripting language the moment it was added to the game in mid 2012. I took a computing GCSE, A-Level and Degree so it's only logical I'd like to keep moving in that direction.</p>
    <p>As stated I do like building and tinkering with software, and this portfolio is a showcase of what I’ve been up to. It isn’t complete yet, as I’m in the process of creating write-ups for all the projects on here, but for now please click through to the GitHub repos & any other relevant links on the right hand side.</p>
